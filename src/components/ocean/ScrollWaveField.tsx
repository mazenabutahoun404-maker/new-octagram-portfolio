/**
 * SCROLL WAVE FIELD — 3D particle wave plane for Framer.
 *
 * A grid of ~10k points sits on a ground plane whose height is a layered sine
 * surface (long diagonal ridge + cross swell). A perspective camera looks
 * slightly down at it from INSIDE the field, so the near rows blow up into big
 * discs and sweep past the bottom edge while the far rows compress into a sharp
 * band at the horizon.
 *
 * The motion is entirely time-driven — the field streams endlessly toward the
 * camera and the wave pattern flows one way. Nothing is bound to scroll, so the
 * Framer canvas and the preview render identically with no progress term.
 *
 * There is NO depth of field. Every point is a hard-edged disc sized purely by
 * perspective (`uDot * focal / depth`), so the near rows are large and crisp
 * rather than soft bokeh; overlapping discs still bloom to a hot core through
 * the additive blend.
 *
 * Cursor is ray-cast onto the ground plane and lifts the surface with a
 * gaussian bump — a real 3D deformation, not a screen-space warp.
 *
 * Rule 6 recipe: ONE GL context built in useEffect([]); every live input read
 * from a ref inside a raw rAF loop (raw rAF ticks on the Framer canvas, unlike
 * IntersectionObserver / framer-motion appear props). Never calls
 * loseContext() — getContext() hands back the SAME force-lost context on the
 * next StrictMode mount and renders black.
